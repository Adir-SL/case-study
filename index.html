                        <p>"When I first spoke with Karen and Ido, I told them straight up—I’m super skeptical about an external studio running the Design Ops. I figured, at best, they could help us skip some of the learning curves our in-house designers were facing because, in the end, this kind of role has to live inside the company,  A studio can offer best practices and a holistic view, but there’s no way they can really deal with the messy reality of working across designers, devs, PMs, and biz teams. Yep, I have this habit of saying a lot of stupid things... We kicked things off with research and workshops, built workflows, mapped out a roadmap, ran stakeholder sessions, and boosted our Figma game and collaboration—Kido was everywhere, at every level, from high-level strategy to the tiniest day-to-day. Once the roadmap was set, it was clear they weren’t going anywhere—and that they shouldn’t. The strongest success metric? Not just the time we saved (a lot), the improved delivery (yep), or even the professional growth across the team (big time). It’s the people’s faces when they think Kido might leave. Once you start working with them, there’s no going back, somewhat like Jack once said: Because deep down, in places you don’t talk about at Configs, you want them in that mess — you need them in that mess!"</p>

                            They helped us take an early version of our design system — one that didn’t quite match how we work — and turn it into something that actually fits our day-to-day needs. They brought in best practices and a fresh perspective, kept things practical, and made sure the whole team was part of the process.
                            <br/><br/>
                            On top of that, Kido's team have been amazing partners on different product design projects — thoughtful, collaborative, and always focused on what really matters. The team at Kido brings innovative ideas to the table, knows exactly when to push forward and when to pause and reflect, and their deliverables are consistently of the highest quality you could ask for. It honestly feels like they’re part of the team."</p>

                            Throughout the discovery phase, the Kido team demonstrated a methodological, thorough, and insightful approach. Their professionalism and innovative thinking enabled them to successfully pinpoint the precise direction needed for an effective application tailored to a large-scale insurance agency such as Mivtach Simon.

Their efforts significantly contributed to the project's clarity and strategic direction, delivering outstanding results that exceeded our expectations.

                        <p>"Our journey with Kido began due to a simple plugin - Left-to-Right - which opened the door for us at Maccabi Healthcare to adopt Figma – the industry standard. Our other goal was to use Figma as a foundation for building a design system across our many products, and to improve the design system already in production.
                            <br/><br/>
                            To do so in the most professional and effective way, we approached Ido and the team for a training workshop and a few consulting hours. But what started as a one-time collaboration quickly grew into a long-term, trusted partnership. The Kido team didn’t just advise — they got in the trenches with us. From building pixel-perfect components, through driving complex organizational processes, to delivering handoffs for development — they have been with us every step of the way. There are many opportunities ahead, more challenges to meet — but the road is paved, and we’re walking it together.
                            <br/><br/>
                            To us, Kido became a part of our small talented team. Experts in design systems, with deep understanding of both design and development. Together, we’re creating better products and delivering smarter, faster solutions to our users — and that’s what it’s all about."</p>
