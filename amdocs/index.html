                <h3>Innovative product approach</h3>
                <p>By conducting workshops with decision-makers and management, significant breakthroughs in the work
                    process were facilitated. The aim was to create innovative concepts that approach security
                    holistically and transform the product into a flexible platform. This was achieved through the use
                    of structured methods to gather observations, challenge cognitive fixedness, and generate creative
                    solutions.</p>
                <h4>Query Builder</h4>
                <p>To improve the user experience and address confusion from the previous query system, a new and
                    user-friendly query builder was introduced. This involved implementing a data categorization model
                    to enhance user navigation through extensive data. The focus was on simplicity and ease of use in
                    the query builder, empowering users to efficiently explore the system's vast amount of data without
                    feeling overwhelmed.</p>

                <h3>Maps</h3>
                <p>Extensive enhancements were made to the existing map schema, which was originally derived from a web
                    library.<br />The map underwent a complete redesign, including the revamping of the menu and action
                    bars, aimed at improving usability. A hierarchical structure was implemented, accompanied by various
                    refinements to ensure a seamless user experience. These enhancements not only contribute to an
                    aesthetically pleasing interface but also enable effortless navigation and interaction with the map
                    system.<br />As a result, users can effortlessly access and leverage the map functionalities to
                    effectively analyze and respond to cybersecurity threats.</p>

                    quickly access relevant and up-to-date data. This comprehensive approach facilitated efficient

                <h3>Product maintenance while developing new features</h3>
                <p>Continuous enhancement of the product experience was the goal, achieved through regular updates and
                    refinements to the user interface. The focus was on creating a consistent experience throughout the
                    product.</p>

                        Small fixes and releases are worked on simultaneously and consistently while the main product
                        and feature continue to be developed.

                <h3>Building the DesignOps Foundation</h3>
                <p>Robust Design operation foundation was established by driving changes in work processes across teams,
                    management, and handoff procedures. The focus on Design Ops involved supporting design processes
                    while continuously enhancing the product. Systematic infrastructures were implemented to create
                    clarity and a shared understanding of the broad design process. This resulted in fewer unanswered
                    questions and improved collaboration among teams. Conduct collaborative workshops to identify and
                    address inefficiencies in the design process, improving workflows and team communication. Establish
                    a centralized design system and a knowledge repository to promote consistency and provide easy
                    access to design guidelines and assets. Implement regular user feedback loops and testing sessions
                    to validate design decisions and enhance the product based on user needs and expectations.</p>

                <h3>Scaling the design team</h3>
                <p>To scale the design team, we support hiring and onboarding new designers. As part of our legacy we
                    provide inspiration and training in adopting correct work models, ensuring the team is equipped with
                    the necessary knowledge and skills.</p>
