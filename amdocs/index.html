                <p>Amdocs, a leading software and services provider to communications and media companies, offers
                    innovative solutions and intelligent operations to global brands such as AT&T, Vodafone, and
                    T-Mobile. To serve their customers' design needs quickly and efficiently, Amdocs has a team of
                    approximately 70 experienced UI and UX designers worldwide, supported by a dedicated Design Ops team
                    responsible for design operations and system infrastructure.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We partnered with Amdocs at a crucial point in their transition from several tools used in day to
                    day design processes: Sketch, Axure, Invision, and Zeplin to Figma. This migration required
                    comprehensive training for teams unfamiliar with Figma and the unification and transfer of robust
                    design system documentation.

                    Our primary challenge though was to create a single, unified library of base components used across

                <h2 class="alternate black">1. The Foundation</h2>
                <p>Before the release of Figma variables, options for theming and mode support were limited. Plugins
                    like Themer allowed for color switching between modes, but they had to be linked to specific Figma
                    files and installed by every user. Tokens Studio offered (and still does!) a more flexible solution
                    for theming and scaling design systems, and we were close to adopting it despite some drawbacks in
                    prototype mode. However, just as we were about to commit, Figma announced the beta release of
                    variables. We decided to wait and focus on other foundational tasks like building the component
                    structure and transferring documentation into Figma.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="third-size"></div>

            <div class="columnDiv third-size left-align no-gap">

                <p>When Figma variables were released, albeit in beta mode, we decided to integrate them, opting for a
                    native solution. Through extensive research, trial and error, we developed a sustainable and
                    feasible solution for our unified base library, making it a robust foundation for our design system.
                    In the process we also communicated with the Figma Product team and validated our suggested
                    architecture with them.Â </p>

            <div class="columnDiv third-size left-align no-gap">

                <p>The final solution included creating a variable collection that was split into 2 subgroups of
                    variables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customizable (i.e. changing per each customer)</li>
                    <li>Non-customizable (aliasing the variables from the Customizable group) that covers all the system
                        and component tokens.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In order to enable both client themes and light and dark modes switching, the variable modes were
                    used.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>The final foundation architecture looked as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colors collection (customizable values changing per customer)</li>
                    <li>Aliased variables (system and component tokens):Â </li>
                    <li>Modes and client themes management</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As a result, with every new client, the Design Ops team had to only create a new mode, name it with
                    the
                    clientâs name and mode indication (light/dark) and enter the new raw hex values in the customizable
                    part
                    of the collection (colors such as brand, primary, secondary and so on).Â </p>

                <h2 class="alternate black">2. Components</h2>
                <p>While exploring variables and consulting with the Figma Product team, we also focused on creating
                    flexible components. These components needed to be versatile enough to meet any design requirement,
                    despite not knowing the exact content. We implemented a slot approach and straightforward
                    documentation to communicate design decisions that must remain fixed and those that could be
                    modified. There were a handful of components (mostly organisms) designed, for example, with a
                    defined header and footer and a flexible middle slot, allowing for updates without restricting
                    designers.</p>
                <p><br />
                    As a result, the designers could create custom content, make it a local component and then replace
                    the slot in the base component to create any required layouts and designs without detaching the
                    components from the system.</p>

                <p>Training was a crucial part of the transition to Figma. We conducted 16 training sessions with Amdocs
                    design teams in Israel and India, delivering the sessions in two languages. These sessions covered
                    all the essentials to help teams kickstart their work in Figma, ensuring a smooth transition from
                    their previous tools.</p>
                <p>The training program was comprehensive and included the following elements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction to Figma: We provided an overview of Figma and its features, highlighting the

                    <li>Hands-On Workshops: We conducted hands-on workshops where designers could practice using Figma
                    </li>
                    <li>Office hours: We held office hours to address any questions or concerns, providing additional

                <h2 class="alternate black">4. Documentation</h2>
                <p>We created a mini-design system for documentation as well, connecting documentation components in
                    prototype mode. This allowed all documentation consumers to view it both on the canvas and in
                    presentation mode. Additionally, thanks to Figma variables, the documentation itself was made
                    themeable, enhancing its usability and adaptability.
                    The documentation process involved several key steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standardize Documentation Format: We standardized the format for documentation, ensuring
                        consistency and clarity across all documents.</li>
                    <li>Connect Documentation Components: We connected documentation components in prototype mode,
                        making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the documentation.</li>
                    <li>Implement Theming: We used Figma variables to implement theming for the documentation, allowing
                        it to be customized to match different brand guidelines.</li>
                    <li>Create Templates: We created templates for common documentation types, making it easy for
                        designers to create new documents quickly and efficiently.</li>

                    with specific layouts and designated areas for all design stakeholders, including designers, product
                    managers, and developers. This structured approach facilitated clearer communication and more
