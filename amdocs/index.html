                <p>Amdocs, a leading software and services provider to communications and media companies, offers
                    innovative solutions and intelligent operations to global brands such as AT&T, Vodafone, and
                    T-Mobile. To serve their customers' design needs quickly and efficiently, Amdocs has a team of
                    approximately 70 experienced UI and UX designers worldwide, supported by a dedicated Design Ops team
                    responsible for design operations and system infrastructure.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We partnered with Amdocs at a crucial point in their transition from several tools used in day to
                    day design processes: Sketch, Axure, Invision, and Zeplin to Figma. This migration required
                    comprehensive training for teams unfamiliar with Figma and the unification and transfer of robust
                    design system documentation.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our primary challenge though was to create a single, unified library of base components used across
                    all
                    products, each with its specific branding.</p>

                <h2 class="alternate black">1. The Foundation</h2>
                <p>Before the release of Figma variables, options for theming and mode support were limited. Plugins like Themer allowed for color switching between modes, but they had to be linked to specific Figma files and installed by every user. Tokens Studio offered (and still does!) a more flexible solution for theming and scaling design systems, and we were close to adopting it despite some drawbacks in prototype mode. However, just as we were about to commit, Figma announced the beta release of variables. We decided to wait and focus on other foundational tasks like building the component structure and transferring documentation into Figma.</p>

                <p>To provide users with a clear and actionable view within the system, dynamic widget systems were
                    implemented to create security views. These views integrated query results, ensuring users could
                    quickly access relevant and up-to-date data. This comprehensive approach facilitated efficient
                    monitoring and management across various business verticals.</p>

                <h3>Product maintenance while developing new features</h3>
                <p>Continuous enhancement of the product experience was the goal, achieved through regular updates and
                    refinements to the user interface. The focus was on creating a consistent experience throughout the
                    product.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Small fixes and releases are worked on simultaneously and consistently while the main product
                        and feature continue to be developed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improving the product experience.

                    <li>
                        Creating consistency throughout the product.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Building the DesignOps Foundation</h3>
                <p>Robust Design operation foundation was established by driving changes in work processes across teams,
                    management, and handoff procedures. The focus on Design Ops involved supporting design processes
                    while continuously enhancing the product. Systematic infrastructures were implemented to create
                    clarity and a shared understanding of the broad design process. This resulted in fewer unanswered
                    questions and improved collaboration among teams. Conduct collaborative workshops to identify and
                    address inefficiencies in the design process, improving workflows and team communication. Establish
                    a centralized design system and a knowledge repository to promote consistency and provide easy
                    access to design guidelines and assets. Implement regular user feedback loops and testing sessions
                    to validate design decisions and enhance the product based on user needs and expectations.</p>

                <h3>Scaling the design team</h3>
                <p>To scale the design team, we support hiring and onboarding new designers. As part of our legacy we
                    provide inspiration and training in adopting correct work models, ensuring the team is equipped with
                    the necessary knowledge and skills.</p>
