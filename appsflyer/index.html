                <p>
                    When AppsFlyer set out to reimagine its brand, the company’s goal was to redefine how it
                    communicates across every touchpoint.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our role at Kido was to translate that renewed brand into the digital space - bringing it to life
                    through the company’s marketing website and building the design system that would sustain it at
                    scale.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="bigger-haas">
                    But this time, the challenge was unlike any other: the brand was still being created by AppsFlyer
                    while the website and design system implementation had already begun.
                </p>

                <h2 class="alternate black">All engines are on </h2>
                <p>
                    Brand, design system, and development - started running in parallel. Every new brand decision
                    finalized by AppsFlyer’s team was immediately cascaded into the design system, and from there, into
                    live development.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This was a new kind of collaboration - one that proved that speed and structure don’t compete; they
                    reinforce each other.

                    The Mission: Infrastructure, Not Just Interface
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mission was to bring the new AppsFlyer brand to life on their marketing site - not as a one-off
                    redesign, but as a system that could grow, evolve, and scale.
                    To achieve that, we established a multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers, and marketing
                    experts working together. The guiding principle was to treat every design decision as infrastructure
                    - not just visuals.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our teams worked hand-in-hand to translate brand strategy into tangible design
                    language:
                </p>
                <ul>

                        Defining the new and redesigned pages architecture UX and content hierarchy

                    <li>
                        Establishing a shared visual vocabulary through grids, spacing and colors - All, of course,
                    </li>

                        systemized and tokenized in Figma.

                        Creating reusable components and page sections that would serve both current and future

                        needs.

                    Instead of treating the design system as an afterthought, we used it as the foundation of the entire
                    rebrand rollout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every finalized design decision - from typography and color tokens to interactive elements and page
                    templates - went straight into the design system inside Figma.
                    That system then became the bridge between design and development, allowing us to:

                        Ensure brand consistency across 1,000+ pages

                        Keep design and engineering fully aligned as the brand evolved

                <p>
                    By the end of the process, we had proven that a Design System for a marketing website can be not
                    only a design framework - but an operational engine that powers brand transformation in real time.

                <p>
                    The heart of this project was the methodology itself: we didn’t wait for the brand to be complete
                    before starting.

                <p>
                    While AppsFlyer’s internal teams were still refining brand principles, our designers and developers
                    were already applying them - component by component, page by page. Every new decision was validated
                    in production and immediately scaled through the system.

                        Brand exploration and visual definition by AppsFlyer’s teams ran in parallel to Kido’s web

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each approved decision was integrated into the design system
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Figma libraries served as the single synchronization layer between design and dev
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    The process allowed us to maintain both agility and alignment, reducing redundant work while
                    creating a more stable, scalable product. Over time, the system began to accelerate itself: fewer
                    new components were needed, while existing ones evolved seamlessly through the system
