                <p>
                    When AppsFlyer set out to reimagine its brand, the company’s goal was to redefine how it
                    communicates across every touchpoint.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our role at Kido was to translate that renewed brand into the digital space - bringing it to life
                    through the company’s marketing website and building the design system that would sustain it at
                    scale.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="bigger-haas">
                    But this time, the challenge was unlike any other: the brand was still being created by AppsFlyer
                    while the website and design system implementation had already begun.
                </p>

                <h2 class="alternate black">All engines are on </h2>
                <p>
                    Brand, design system, and development - started running in parallel. Every new brand decision
                    finalized by AppsFlyer’s team was immediately cascaded into the design system, and from there, into
                    live development.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This was a new kind of collaboration - one that proved that speed and structure don’t compete; they
                    reinforce each other.

                    The Mission: Infrastructure, Not Just Interface
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mission was to bring the new AppsFlyer brand to life on their marketing site - not as a one-off
                    redesign, but as a system that could grow, evolve, and scale.
                    To achieve that, we established a multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers, and marketing
                    experts working together. The guiding principle was to treat every design decision as infrastructure
                    - not just visuals.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our teams worked hand-in-hand to translate brand strategy into tangible design
                    language:
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Defining the new and redesigned pages architecture UX and content hierarchy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Establishing a shared visual vocabulary through grids, spacing and colors - All, of course,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        systemized and tokenized in Figma.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating reusable components and page sections that would serve both current and future
                        marketing
                        needs.
