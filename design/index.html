                <h3>Innovative product approach</h3>
                <p>By conducting workshops with decision-makers and management, significant breakthroughs in the work process were facilitated. The aim was to create innovative concepts that approach security holistically and transform the product into a flexible platform. This was achieved through the use of structured methods to gather observations, challenge cognitive fixedness, and generate creative solutions.</p>
                <h4>Query Builder</h4>
                <p>To improve the user experience and address confusion from the previous query system, a new and user-friendly query builder was introduced. This involved implementing a data categorization model to enhance user navigation through extensive data. The focus was on simplicity and ease of use in the query builder, empowering users to efficiently explore the system's vast amount of data without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

                <h3>Maps</h3>
                <p>Extensive enhancements were made to the existing map schema, which was originally derived from a web library. The map underwent a complete redesign, including the revamping of the menu and action bars, aimed at improving usability. A hierarchical structure was implemented, accompanied by various refinements to ensure a seamless user experience. These enhancements not only contribute to an aesthetically pleasing interface but also enable effortless navigation and interaction with the map system. As a result, users can effortlessly access and leverage the map functionalities to effectively analyze and respond to cybersecurity threats.</p>

                <h3>Security views</h3>
                <p>To provide users with a clear and actionable view within the system, dynamic widget systems were implemented to create security views. These views integrated query results, ensuring users could quickly access relevant and up-to-date data. This comprehensive approach facilitated efficient monitoring and management across various business verticals.</p>

                <h3>Product maintenance while developing new features</h3>
                <p>Continuous enhancement of the product experience was the goal, achieved through regular updates and refinements to the user interface. The focus was on creating a consistent experience throughout the product.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Small fixes and releases are worked on simultaneously and consistently while the main product and feature continue to be developed.

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Building the DesignOps Foundation</h3>
                <p>Robust Design operation foundation was established by driving changes in work processes across teams, management, and handoff procedures. The focus on Design Ops involved supporting design processes while continuously enhancing the product. Systematic infrastructures were implemented to create clarity and a shared understanding of the broad design process. This resulted in fewer unanswered questions and improved collaboration among teams. Conduct collaborative workshops to identify and address inefficiencies in the design process, improving workflows and team communication. Establish a centralized design system and a knowledge repository to promote consistency and provide easy access to design guidelines and assets. Implement regular user feedback loops and testing sessions to validate design decisions and enhance the product based on user needs and expectations.</p>

                <h3>Scaling the design team</h3>
                <p>To scale the design team, we support hiring and onboarding new designers. As part of our legacy we provide inspiration and training in adopting correct work models, ensuring the team is equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills.</p>
