                        One of our key challenges was finding a way to make Anodot's complex AI technology more accessible and understandable to their audience. The main issue was that businesses are missing out on a significant amount of valuable data. To solve this, we had to demystify technical jargon and present the information in a clear and engaging way.

                        We utilized basic geometric shapes in our branding process to illustrate a complicated concept, which proved to be highly effective in simplifying and clarifying our message. These shapes were then expanded into a set of distinct icons, each representing one of Anodot's product solutions and the various industries it serves.
