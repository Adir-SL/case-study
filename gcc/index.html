                    Following a previous collaboration with the client, we were invited to take on a significantly more
                    ambitious challenge:
                </p>
                <p class="bigger-haas">
                    Build and launch three websites - including two full brand creations - in under 10 weeks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each website served a different purpose and a different audience:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Amel</b> an existing brand needing a structured uplift and a new website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Mossadad</b> a new brand and website built from scratch.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Dario</b> a consumer-facing product requiring its own brand identity and a website with a
                        more
                        complex product flow.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The core question was:
                </p>
                <p class="bigger-haas">
                    How do you build multiple brands and multiple websites in parallel without sacrificing quality or
                    coherence?

                    Development-First, System-Driven Thinking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From day one, we understood that the only way to achieve this scale and speed was to treat the three
                    websites as a system, not as three separate projects.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our methodology was built on three pillars:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Development-First Planning
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Before designing anything, we defined a shared wireframe architecture for all three websites.
                        This allowed us to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Reuse components and structures
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Accelerate decisions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shorten the time between design and development handoff
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        This system-first approach meant that every design decision was rooted in feasibility - enabling
                        speed.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        High-Intensity Collaboration & Weekly Decisions
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        The compressed timeline required weekly decision cycles with the client.
                        <br />
                        <u>No long iterations</u>
                        <br />
                        <u>No “we'll decide next week.</u>
                        <br />
                        <u>”No endless explorations.</u>
                        <br /><br />
                    <p>
                        This worked because the relationship was built on trust from previous collaboration - a crucial
                        requirement for a process this fast and this agile.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        Lean Branding for Speed & Clarity
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        For Mossadad and Dario we ran a lean, focused branding process, designed to create usable
                        guidelines quickly:
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Rapid research into audience, product value, and category
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A compact exploration phase
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Visual foundations aligned to the shared wireframe system
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The result:
                </p>
                <p class="bigger-haas">
                    Two full brand identities developed in record time, tightly connected to the website structure they
                    would live in.

                <p class="bigger-haas">
                    Instead of treating the design system as an afterthought, we used it as the foundation of the entire
                    rebrand rollout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every finalized design decision - from typography and color tokens to interactive elements and page
                    templates - went straight into the design system inside Figma.
                    That system then became the bridge between design and development, allowing us to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Move approved visual patterns directly into coded components
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure brand consistency across 1,000+ pages
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Minimize back-and-forth and accelerate delivery
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep design and engineering fully aligned as the brand evolved
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By the end of the process, we had proven that a Design System for a marketing website can be not
                    only a design framework - but an operational engine that powers brand transformation in real time.

                    Shipping While Building
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The heart of this project was the methodology itself: we didn’t wait for the brand to be complete
                    before starting.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    While AppsFlyer’s internal teams were still refining brand principles, our designers and developers
                    were already applying them - component by component, page by page. Every new decision was validated
                    in production and immediately scaled through the system.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <b>How it worked:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Brand exploration and visual definition by AppsFlyer’s teams ran in parallel to Kido’s web
                        implementation efforts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each approved decision was integrated into the design system
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Figma libraries served as the single synchronization layer between design and dev
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Development continuously shipped new pages using the latest to

                <p class="bigger-haas">
                    The process allowed us to maintain both agility and alignment, reducing redundant work while
                    creating a more stable, scalable product. Over time, the system began to accelerate itself: fewer
                    new components were needed, while existing ones evolved seamlessly through the system

                    At Kido, we believe that modern brands are no longer made of pages and pixels - they’re made of
                    <b>systems and decisions.</b>
