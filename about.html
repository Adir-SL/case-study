            <h3 class="half-size">It unfolded spontaneously during a random meetup, where two creative minds  decided to collaborate for the first time. We grew into a real business In 2021 when we finally admitted it to ourselves and our team, we signed the lease to our new offices and named ourselves Kido.</h3>
            <h3 class="half-size">As we grew, we learned what it takes to deliver exceptional design for our clients. We created a structured process for our designers, became more transparent about how we do business, became pickier about the projects we take on, and focused on the true value we bring to our partnerships.</h3>
            <h3 class="half-size">Today, we are working on putting our experience to use in the best way possible, while exploring new paths and partnerships and growing our team to provide a one stop shop for strategic design offerings.</h3>
